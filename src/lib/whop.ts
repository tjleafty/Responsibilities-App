// Whop funnel primitives (provided by OverSkill template).
//
// Thin client-side helpers wrapping the most common operations a Whop-backed
// funnel needs. Import from here rather than reinventing the wheel each time.
//
// Architecture:
//   - createCheckoutSession() — mints a Whop checkout-configuration session
//     (`ch_xxx`) for a plan_id via the OverSkill worker. The browser MUST
//     pass that id to the embed as `sessionId` — Whop's current (v3) embed
//     protocol throws "`sessionKey` is a required property" when the embed
//     mounts with only a planId. Use the useCheckoutSession() hook
//     (@/hooks/useCheckoutSession) to fetch it; or CheckoutDialog /
//     pre-built components that do it for you.
//   - The browser embeds Whop's checkout via @whop/checkout (see
//     <WhopCheckoutEmbed planId="..." sessionId="...">). The embed fires
//     postMessage events when checkout completes.
//   - completeCheckout() — runs once the embed reports a receiptId. Hits the
//     OverSkill worker at /api/whop/checkout-complete which looks up the
//     payment + saved card via the app's sub-merchant API key (server-side
//     only, never exposed to the browser).
//   - chargeUpsell() — runs off-session charges for upsell pages later in the
//     funnel using the saved paymentMethodId. When the generated-app Whop
//     capability canary is enabled, pass the signed checkout/session
//     capability returned by completeCheckout().
//
// Server-side: see app/services/deployment/worker_api_template.rb for the
// /api/whop/checkout-complete and /api/whop/charge route handlers. The app's
// per-merchant whop_api_key (ak_xxx) lives in worker env as WHOP_API_KEY and
// is never sent to the browser.

 * Resolve the post-purchase / post-signup destination: the app's PRIMARY

 *
 * Resolution order (mirrors the OAuth callback's post-login route in
 * `src/routes/callback.tsx` — `storedRedirect || VITE_POST_LOGIN_ROUTE ||
 * '/dashboard'` — so the page a buyer lands on after a PURCHASE is the SAME
 * one they'd reach after a normal login, never a divergent hardcoded
 * literal):
 *   1. An explicit `destination` the caller passed (the offer page knows
 *      exactly where its paid feature lives — strongly preferred).
 *   2. `import.meta.env.VITE_POST_LOGIN_ROUTE` — the app's configured
 *      primary authenticated route. Setting this makes the fallback follow
 *      the app's REAL main surface (e.g. `/studio`, `/workspace`) instead of
 *      a hardcoded `/dashboard`.
 *   3. `/dashboard` — last-resort literal (the template's default protected
 *      route).
 *
 * WHY (issue #2524, app eVPKEj / "Thumbnail Studio"): the old hardcoded
 * `/dashboard` fallback dropped a paying buyer on a leftover PLACEHOLDER
 * `/dashboard` route that was never wired to the app's actual feature
 * (`/studio`) — a real dead-end after a real purchase, even though checkout
 * AND auth both succeeded. Tie the fallback to `VITE_POST_LOGIN_ROUTE` so
 * the destination follows the app's configured primary surface, and pass an
 * explicit `destination` from the offer page whenever the feature route is
 * known.

// postPurchaseRedirect — the canonical post-checkout routing helper.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Route the buyer correctly AFTER a successful checkout — the single
 * canonical helper every `onComplete` should call.
 *
 * OverSkill's default purchase flow is purchase -> login/signup ->
 * access. The post-purchase destination (e.g. /dashboard) is ALWAYS
 * auth-gated (wrapped in <ProtectedRoute> or VITE_APP_VISIBILITY). So
 * `onComplete` must NEVER blind-navigate a signed-OUT buyer straight
 * into protected content — they'd just bounce to /login with no email
 * context and the purchase wouldn't reconcile to an account.
 *
 * The `destination` is resolved via `resolvePostPurchaseDestination`:
 * an explicit `opts.destination` wins, else `VITE_POST_LOGIN_ROUTE`,
 * else `/dashboard`. Pass the app's REAL primary route (the page that
 * renders the paid feature — e.g. `/studio`) as `destination` — do NOT
 * rely on the bare `/dashboard` literal, which may be a placeholder that
 * isn't wired to the feature the buyer paid for (#2524).
 *
 * This helper resolves that:
 *   - Signed-IN buyer  → navigate(destination) directly.
 *   - Signed-OUT buyer → navigate(/login?redirect=<destination>&claim=1
 *                        [&email=<buyer email>]). After they create /
 *                        sign into their account (with the prefilled
 *                        checkout email), the platform reconciles the
 *                        anonymous purchase to their new account by
 *                        email and <ProtectedRoute> lets them in.
 *
 * Pass the `user` from `useAuth()` (or null). Pass the buyer's
 * `email` (from `completeCheckout(...).memberEmail`) when you have it
 * so signup prefills the matching address — strongly recommended for
 * anonymous checkouts, since email-match is how the claim works.
 *
 * Always pair the embed with `returnUrl={`${window.location.origin}/checkout/complete`}`
 * (REQUIRED — without it Whop strands the buyer on its own hub after
 * purchase) plus a public `/checkout/complete` route that calls this
 * helper on `?status=success`. `onComplete` is the in-SPA happy path;
 * `returnUrl` is the guaranteed fallback when Whop does a full
 * top-window redirect.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const navigate = useNavigate();
 * const { user } = useAuth();
 *
 * // Pass the app's REAL primary route (the page that renders the paid
 * // feature) as `destination` — here `/studio`, not a placeholder.
 * <WhopCheckoutEmbed
 *   planId={import.meta.env.VITE_PLAN_PRO}
 *   returnUrl={`${window.location.origin}/checkout/complete`}
 *   onComplete={() => postPurchaseRedirect(navigate, user, { destination: "/studio" })}
 * />
 *
 * // With email prefill for the anonymous-buyer claim (recommended):
 * <WhopCheckoutEmbed
 *   planId={import.meta.env.VITE_PLAN_PRO}
 *   returnUrl={`${window.location.origin}/checkout/complete`}
 *   onComplete={async (planId, receiptId) => {
 *     const { memberEmail } = await completeCheckout({ planId, receiptId });
 *     postPurchaseRedirect(navigate, user, { destination: "/studio", email: memberEmail });
 *   }}
 * />
 * ```
