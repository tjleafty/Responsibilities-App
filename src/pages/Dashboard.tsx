/**
 * Dashboard Page (Protected)
 *
 * This is the main app area where authenticated users interact with the app.
 * This page is ALWAYS protected - users must be logged in to access it.
 *
 * Architecture: "Public Landing + Protected Interior"
 * - / (landing) -> Always public
 * - /dashboard (this page) -> Protected, main app functionality
 * - /settings, /profile -> Protected
 *
 * Put the app's main functionality HERE on the dashboard, not on the landing
 * page — the landing page is for marketing/CTA only.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ENTITY ACCESS PATTERN (reference — this scaffold ships NO live entity calls)
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠️ This starter page deliberately makes ZERO `overskill.entities.*` calls.
 * An entity call against an entity that was never created with
 * os-create-entity fails at runtime (404 "Not Found") for every real user —
 * so entity plumbing and os-create-entity MUST land in the SAME turn.
 *
 * When you build the app's real functionality here:
 *   1. Create each entity FIRST: os-create-entity (entity_name: 'item', ...)
 *   2. Then use the client (imported from @/lib/auth):
 *
 *   import { overskill } from "@/lib/auth"
 *
 *   const items   = await overskill.entities.item.list()
 *   const active  = await overskill.entities.item.filter({ done: false })
 *   const found   = await overskill.entities.item.search(term)   // server-side FTS5
 *   const newItem = await overskill.entities.item.create({ title: "New" })
 *   await overskill.entities.item.update(itemId, { done: true })
 *   await overskill.entities.item.delete(itemId)
 *
 * FETCH-ON-MOUNT AUTH GUARD (required for any page fetching user-scoped
 * entities): OAuth callback lands with #access_token=... in the URL hash and
 * React's useEffect can fire BEFORE auth.ts finishes extracting it — causing
 * 401 "API Error" toasts on first load after login. Always gate mount-time
 * fetches on auth state and re-run once it resolves:
 *
 *   const { user, loading: authLoading } = useAuth();
 *   const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
 *   useEffect(() => {
 *     if (authLoading) return;        // auth still resolving — wait
 *     if (!user) {                    // REQUIRED — settled and logged OUT.
 *       setIsLoading(false);          // Clear the flag or the page hangs.
 *       return;
 *     }
 *     loadItems();                    // clears isLoading in its finally
 *   }, [authLoading, user]);
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `!user` BRANCH MUST CLEAR YOUR OWN DATA-LOADING FLAG. A data flag
 * declared `useState(true)` is only ever cleared inside the fetch, so if the
 * effect returns early for a logged-out visitor the flag stays true FOREVER.
 * Gate any spinner on it — `if (authLoading || isLoading) return <Spinner/>`
 * — and a logged-out visitor who lands on this route directly (typed URL,
 * bookmark, refresh) gets an infinite spinner that no timeout can clear,
 * because nothing is in flight. It looks like a hung auth check; it is not.
 * Note this bites ONLY on direct navigation: in-app links usually originate
 * from an authenticated session, so the bug hides during click-through QA.
 * A `public`-visibility app is the sharp edge — ProtectedRoute allows anonymous
 * visitors through to user-scoped pages, so the logged-out render really happens.
 * If the route should never render logged-out, redirect in that branch instead:
 * `return <Navigate to="/login" replace />`. Either way, never leave the flag set.
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING (do NOT remove or hollow out):
 * Wrap entity calls in try/catch and surface failures to the user — e.g.
 * toast.error(...) from "@/components/ui/sonner". NEVER swallow errors with
 * an empty catch: silent catches hide real failures (auth issues, network
 * problems, server errors) from users AND from the platform's automated
 * build monitor, so broken apps look "working" until someone reports them.
 *
 *   try {
 *     const items = await overskill.entities.item.list();
 *     setItems(items || []);
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     console.error("Failed to load items:", error);
 *     toast.error("Couldn't load your items.");
 *   }
 * ============================================================================
